## App Requests

NOTE: Even if your app comply's with our rules, we (Universal-Team members) reserve the right to remove your app from our store for any reason at any time.

### Rules
Any app requests must conform to the following rules before they can be added to the database:
1. Do not include any copyrighted content that you don't have the rights to use (i.e. piracy)
   - This includes apps developed with Unity as "Unity for 3DS" can only be legally acquired by signing an NDA that prevents you from developing homebrew with it
   - Loading copyrighted assets externally from the SD card is fine as long as it's not shipped with the application, whether from the script or in the app itself
1. There should be no NSFW content
1. Must have some description of what the app does, whether in the README or in the submitted app description
1. Must have some meaningful functionality (e.g. not just a testing app or a utility that works on outdated ideas)
1. Any forks of existing apps must achieve a different goal/target audience than their base app
    - Ideally, forks that only add "more functionality" or different translations should be Pull Requests into the original project's repository rather than being a separate app.
    - If the project that you're forking doesn't have translations, chances are it's not needed.

### Recommendations
These are not strict requirements, but are strongly recommended:
1. The source code should be publicly accessible
1. Use GitHub Releases for app downloads. This makes update tracking and downloads much easier
   - Bitbucket is also supported but not as well. Other sites can be added if they have a good API for it
1. Have a place for public discussion of your app (e.g GitHub Discussions, GBAtemp, Discord server, etc)
1. If a online service component exists, try to make it open source and allow the URL which the apps connects with to be changed, in case the service goes down
